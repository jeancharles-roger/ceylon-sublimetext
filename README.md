ceylon-sublimetext
==================

Simple Ceylon Sublime Text 2 package.

It proposes:
- colour highlighting,
- some snippets,
- a build system.

Syntax highlighting
-------------------

The syntax highlighting should be compatible with Text Mate.


Build
-----

The System has been removed (the last working version is tagged Build).

The build system searches the module name of the file that need to be compiled by traversing the parent directories (including the directory containing the file) for a 'module.ceylon' file. 

If the ceylon command isn't in your PATH, you'll need to complete 'Ceylon.sublime-build' and 'CeylonModule.sublime-build' to set the command right.

Note: On MacOS X, Sublime Text doesn't seem to load '.bash_profile'.
